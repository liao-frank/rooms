# Under construction

This site is still unfinished. Even though _Rooms_ is already capable of much more than what is currently documented, there will be more topics and examples to be added in the future. These include:

- Setting state via actions
- Asymmetric client setups
- Custom room codes such as short codes or vanity codes
- Persistent room member identities such as nicknames and avatars
- Time-based events such as game loops
