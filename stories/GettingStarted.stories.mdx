# Getting started

Basic usage of the `useRoom` hook is very similar to using `useState` in React.

1. Within a functional component, call `useRoom` with an ID specific to that piece of state.

```ts
const { state, setState } = useRoom<number>('unique-id', /* Initial state: */ 0)
```

2. Call `setState` to change the state across all clients that are calling the hook with the same ID.

```ts
setState(42)
```

That's it! No servers needed. Whenever new clients call the hook, they will be automatically synced up with everyone else.

### Example: Shared input

<br />

<SharedInput />

This example is one of the simplest ways to use the `useRoom` hook. Typing in the input box above will update it across all clients that are on this page.

Sample code:

```tsx
const SharedInput = () => {
  const { state: value, setState: setValue } = useRoom<string>('unique-id', '')

  return (
    <Input
      onChange={(event) => void setValue(event.target.value)}
      value={value}
    />
  )
}
```
