# Connection status

The `useRoom` hook also returns a `status` value, which describes the connection status of the room. The status can be one of three values: `connecting`, `connected`, and `disconnected`. This value can be used to implement loading screens or to otherwise tell users if they are connected to their room or not.

### Example: Loading tip

<p>
  <LoadingTip />
</p>

This example implements a loading screen with a fun fact that is displayed while connecting to the example room.

Sample code:

```tsx
export const LoadingTip = () => {
  const { status } = useRoom<null>(ROOM_ID, null)

  return (
    <div>
      {status !== ConnectionStatus.Connected
        ? 'Fun fact: Pangolins are the only known mammals covered with scales\nConnecting... ‚è≥'
        : 'You are connected to room ' + ROOM_ID}
    </div>
  )
}
```

<p>
  <ExampleLink example={LoadingTip} />
</p>
